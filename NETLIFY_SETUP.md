## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Netlify Pro (Recommended)
- Upgrade to Netlify Pro ($19/month) to get unlimited environment variables
- This is the cleanest solution for production use

### Option 2: Use Vercel (Free Alternative)
- Vercel offers free environment variables on their free plan
- Deploy using: `vercel --prod`

### Option 3: Use Railway (Free Alternative)
- Railway offers free environment variables
- Deploy using: `railway up`

### Option 4: Use Render (Free Alternative)
- Render offers free environment variables
- Deploy using their dashboard

## Current Setup

Your app now uses Netlify Functions instead of Next.js API routes:
- `/api/fetch-rate` â†’ `/.netlify/functions/fetch-rate`
- `/api/submit-transaction` â†’ `/.netlify/functions/submit-transaction`

This allows environment variables to work on Netlify's free plan.

## Testing Locally

To test the Netlify Functions locally:

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Start local development
netlify dev
```

This will start both your Next.js app and the Netlify Functions locally.
